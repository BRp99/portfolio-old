          <p> This is a demo of a project where I explored using Next.js with TypeScript, combined with Blocknative and Web3-Onboard.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Through this project, I learned how to connect Ethereum wallets using the ethers.js library;</li>
            <li>
              I explored how to integrate secure and efficient authentication with Blocknative, while taking advantage of TypeScript's powerful typing
              system to ensure more robust and error-free code.

          <p> Later, there are plans to explore dynamic data loading using Selenium.</p>

            In this project I create posts dedicated to solving the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, where I can improve my skills in problem solving,
            programming logic and algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the fundamental decisions for this project is the choice of programming language, and I am determined to learn Python, as it can
            open doors to a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and artificial intelligence.

            Each project I present here is not just a code, but a learning path, where each line written represents a discovery and implementation of
            new technologies and approaches.
