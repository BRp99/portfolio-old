          <p>
            In this project I create posts dedicated to solving the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, where I can improve my skills in problem solving,
            programming logic and algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the fundamental decisions for this project is the choice of programming language, and I am determined to learn Python, as it can
            open doors to a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and artificial intelligence.

          <p>My next project is continuing my Python journey, focused on web scraping to extract cryptocurrency price data from CoinMarketCap.</p>
          <p>
            Initially, data extraction is performed statically using BeautifulSoup for web scraping and pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib
            for visualization.
          </p>
          <p> Later, there are plans to explore dynamic data loading using Selenium.</p>
