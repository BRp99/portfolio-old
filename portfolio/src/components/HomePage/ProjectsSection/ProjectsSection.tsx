            My next project will be to create a blog-posts dedicated to solving the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, where I can improve my skills in
            problem solving, programming logic and algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the fundamental decisions for this project is the choice of programming language, and I am determined to learn Python, as it can
            open doors to a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and artificial intelligence.
