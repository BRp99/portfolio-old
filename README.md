## Learning

I created this project to show my work developed throughout this year, but also to improve other skills, for example:

- Make each component have its own responsibility;
- Improve the design system and use dark mode for the first time;
- Improve mobile phone responsive.

## Technologies

In this portfolio, I used several technologies, including:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Typescript
- Inkscape

## Purpose

- This portfolio is more than just a collection of projects.
- It is the result of my journey throughout this year, a testimony of my learning, improvement and passion for development.
- Each project I present here is not just a code, but a learning path, where each line written represents a discovery and implementation of new technologies and approaches. ðŸ¥°

Hope you enjoying it! ðŸ™ƒ
